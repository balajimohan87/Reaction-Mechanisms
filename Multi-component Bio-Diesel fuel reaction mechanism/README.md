# Multi-component Bio-Diesel Fuel Reaction Mechanism

A new coupled bio-diesel surrogate and primary reference fuel (PRF) oxidation skeletal mechanism has been developed. The bio-diesel surrogate sub-mechanism consists of oxidation sub-mechanisms of Methyl Decanoate (MD), Methyl 9-Decenoate (MD9D), and n-Heptane fuel components. The MD and MD9D are chosen to represent the saturated and unsaturated methyl esters respectively in bio-diesel fuels. Then, a reduced iso-octane oxidation sub-mechanism is added to the bio-diesel surrogate sub mechanism. Then, all the sub-mechanisms are integrated into a reduced C2â€“C3 mechanism, detailed H2/CO/C1 mechanism, and reduced NOx mechanism based on decoupling methodology. The final mechanism consisted of 68 species and 183 reactions. The mechanism was well-validated with shock-tube ignition delay times, laminar flame speed, and 3D engine simulations.
